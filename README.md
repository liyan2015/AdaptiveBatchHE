AdaptiveBatchHE

This repository is for our IEEE IOT-J 2023 paper "Adaptive Batch Homomorphic Encryption for Joint Federated Learning in Cross-Device Scenarios". 

Our framework consists of the following three key components.

## Clustering of Clients based on Sparsity of CNNs

The code in the folder cnn sparsity is used to obtain the sparse vectors of the client.

## Selection of HE Key Size for Each Client based on Fuzzy Logic

The code in the folder fuzzy logic is used to obtain the key size of the client.
